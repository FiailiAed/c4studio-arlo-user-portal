## Branch: `feat/admin-role-management` (merged)

**Status**: Merged into `development` and confirmed working on the Vercel development deployment. Branch deleted from GitHub. Not yet merged to `main`.

**Purpose**: Allow league admins to assign roles to users from within the app instead of the Clerk Dashboard.

### What was built

- **`app/admin/users/page.tsx`** — Role management table at `/admin/users`. Lists all users (from Convex) with their current role, and a select dropdown to change it. Calls `POST /api/users/role` on change. Optimistic UI update while the webhook propagates.
- **`app/api/users/role/route.ts`** — Server-side route handler. Verifies the caller has `league_admin` role via `sessionClaims`, then calls `clerkClient().users.updateUser()` to write the new role to Clerk `publicMetadata`.
- **`convex/http.ts`** — Convex HTTP router with a `POST /clerk-webhook` handler. Verifies svix signature, handles `user.created` and `user.updated` events, calls `syncFromWebhook` internalMutation to keep Convex in sync.
- **`convex/users.ts`** — Added `listAll` query (league_admin only, returns all users) and `syncFromWebhook` internalMutation. Updated `upsertUser` to patch existing records (not just insert) so Clerk data stays current in Convex.
- **`proxy.ts`** — Added `/admin/*` route guard. Redirects non-`league_admin` users to `/user`.
- **`convex/schema.ts`** — Added `email` and `role` fields to the `users` table.
- **`lib/roles.ts`** — Single source of truth for `AppRole` type and role config (label, description, permissions list).
- **Batch role editing** — `app/admin/users/page.tsx` now has per-row and select-all checkboxes with a bulk action bar to apply one role to multiple selected users at once. `app/api/users/role/route.ts` accepts `userIds: string[]` and updates Clerk in parallel.

### Bugs fixed during this branch

- **Intermittent "Unauthorized" on `/admin/users`** (1-in-5 load rate): `listAll` was throwing when `getUserIdentity()` returned null during the Convex auth token initialization race. Fixed by returning `null` instead of throwing — Convex re-runs the query when the token arrives.
- **Admin table showing no user data**: `upsertUser` was returning early on existing records without updating fields. Fixed to always patch `firstName`/`lastName`/`email`. Effect in `app/user/page.tsx` now runs on every login (not just when `profile === null`).
- **Debug route breaking production build**: A top-level `throw` in `app/api/debug/user-tokens/route.ts` was evaluated at build time by Turbopack. Route was removed entirely.
- **`any` types in `app/api/users/role/route.ts` and `convex/http.ts`**: Both cast Clerk claim/webhook payloads through `any`, violating the project's strict-TypeScript rule. Replaced with a typed `{ role?: AppRole }` cast for session claims and a `ClerkUserEvent` interface for the webhook payload.
- **Clerk webhook failing silently**: Registered in the Clerk Dashboard but `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` was only set in `.env.local`, not in Convex's own environment variables — Convex HTTP actions run in Convex's environment, not Next.js's. Added the secret to the Convex dashboard.

### Completed

- Clerk webhook registered and confirmed working end-to-end (`user.created` / `user.updated` → Convex sync).
- `convex/migrations.ts` (temporary seed migration) deleted now that the webhook reliably keeps Convex in sync.
- `adminrolemanagement.patch` was already absent from the repo root.

Merged into `development` on 2026-07-03; ready to promote to `main` when the team decides.

## Branch: `main` (prior to `feat/admin-role-management`)

**Commits** (most recent first):
- `f43ac06` — Add Permissions section to user page (role badge + permissions list from `lib/roles.ts`)
- `f7ddfd9` — Remove firstName/lastName from Convex schema; names are read from Clerk only
- `d586309` — Add user profile page with Convex schema and Clerk integration
- `e51f879` — Add Clerk authentication and Convex backend
- `422c45a` — Initial commit from Create Next App

### What was built on main

- Clerk authentication with `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 middleware equivalent)
- Convex backend with `users` table, `getCurrentUser`, `upsertUser`, `updateProfile` functions
- User profile page at `/user` showing name, avatar, email, and league-specific fields (phone, DOB, address)
- Edit profile page at `/user/edit` for phone, DOB, and address only (Clerk owns name/email)
- Permissions card on profile showing current role badge and permissions list
- `ConvexClientProvider` using `ConvexProviderWithClerk`
- shadcn/ui components: Avatar, Badge, Card, Button, Separator, Input, Label, Select

### Key decisions made on main

- **Clerk owns name/email/password**. Convex only stores league-specific data. Name fields were initially added to Convex schema but then removed via migration.
- **Role stored in Clerk `publicMetadata.role`**, not a separate Convex roles table. Denormalized/cached to Convex for admin list queries.
- **Session token vs Convex JWT template** are two different tokens. Both need `"metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"` configured separately in the Clerk Dashboard.
